## Overview

This challenge consists of building a complete front-end for managing posts with user identification, full CRUD functionality, infinite scrolling, and local storage persistence. The UI is user-friendly and reactive, supporting optimistic updates and intelligent cache invalidation using `react-query`.

---

### Features

1. **Authentication**
   - [x] User can set a username to identify themselves.
   - [x] Username is stored in state global and persisted across sessions.
   - [x] If the username is not set, navigation to protected routes like `/posts` redirects back to `/` using `useEffect`.

2. **Create Post**
   - [x] Users can create a new post by submitting a form.
   - [x] The post includes the title, content, author, and timestamp.
   - [x] Form inputs are cleared after submission and the button is disabled when the form is invalid or loading.
   - [x] Uses `useMutation` from `react-query` to send POST requests via Axios.
   - [x] After a successful mutation, the post list is automatically updated via `invalidateQueries`.

3. **Read / List Posts**
   - [x] Posts are fetched using `react-query`'s `useInfiniteQuery`.
   - [x] Implements **infinite scrolling** ‚Äì more posts are loaded as the user scrolls down.
   - [x] Posts show title, content, author, and relative date (e.g., ‚Äú2 minutes ago‚Äù) using `date-fns`.
   - [x] Only posts authored by the current user will show **Edit** and **Delete** actions.

4. **Update Post**
   - [x] Users can edit their own posts.
   - [x] The editing interface is simple and reuses the post structure.
   - [x] Upon save, posts are updated in `localStorage` and UI is refreshed.
   - [x] Optimistic UI updates handled via `react-query`.

5. **Delete Post**
   - [x] Users can delete their own posts.
   - [x] A confirmation step ensures posts aren't removed accidentally.
   - [x] The deleted post is removed from both `localStorage` and the cache.

6. **State Management & API Handling**
   - [x] `axios` is used to make API requests with a base URL from `.env`.
   - [x] Includes an optional delay interceptor for simulating slow networks (via `setTimeout`).
   - [x] All interactions are tracked and cached via `react-query` (TanStack Query).

7. **Routing & Error Handling**
   - [x] Uses `react-router-dom` for managing routes.
   - [x] Shared layout handled via `AppLayout`.
   - [x] Includes custom error boundary (`/error`) and 404 Not Found page.
